Graphics: Use only graphics that are hosted on the web.

	 Use this code:

External links: 

	__[link text](http://url)__

Colored note boxes: Use one of these div tags.

	<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
		Tip: Use blue boxes for Tips and notes. If it’s a note, you don’t have to include the word “Note”.
	</div>

	<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
		Example: Use yellow boxes for examples that are not inside code cells, or use for mathematical formulas if needed.
	</div>

	<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
		Up to you: Use green boxes sparingly, and only for some specific
		purpose that the other boxes can't cover. For example, if you have
		a lot of related content to link to, maybe you decide to use green
		boxes for related links from each section of a notebook. 
	</div>

	<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
		Just don't: In general, just avoid the red boxes.
	</div>
